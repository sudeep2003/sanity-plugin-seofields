# Security Policy

Thanks for helping keep `sanity-plugin-seofields` and its users safe.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public GitHub issue**. Report it privately first so there is time to investigate and ship a fix.

## What to expect

After a report is received:

1. I will acknowledge receipt as soon as possible.
2. I will investigate and confirm whether the report is a valid vulnerability.
3. If confirmed, I will work on a fix and coordinate a release.
4. Once a fix is available, I may ask you to help verify it.

I appreciate responsible disclosure and will do my best to keep you informed during the process.
